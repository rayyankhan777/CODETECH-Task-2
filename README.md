# To-Do List Application

A simple to-do list application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The app uses local storage to persist tasks, so users can manage their tasks even after closing the browser.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a to-do list application that:
- **Manages Tasks Efficiently**: Allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Implements CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for tasks.
- **Uses Local Storage**: Saves tasks in the browser's local storage to ensure tasks persist across sessions.

## Key Features

1. **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks and add them to the to-do list.
2. **Edit Tasks**: Tasks can be updated, allowing users to modify existing task descriptions.
3. **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
4. **Persist Tasks with Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage, meaning they persist even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
5. **Task Completion**: (Optional) Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the to-do list application.
- **CSS**: Styling to make the interface visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the core functionality such as adding, editing, deleting tasks, and using local storage for persistence.
- **Local Storage**: Stores tasks in the browser so they persist across sessions.
